# RYM Genre Scraper
SensCritique is a french platform allowing its members to socialize and communicate around sereval cultural and artistic fields (music, cinema, books/BD, TV show, videogames).

RateYourMusic is an anglophone website known for its huge and accurate database regarding music.

This extension allows you to scrape music genre informations on a RYM record et display it on the corresponding record on SensCritique. Both websites doesn't provide APIs in order to easily access and manipulate their data, that's why this extension is kind of experimental and will remain unstable until I can rebuild it using APIs.Nevertheless, I like it as a user and music lover and decided to propose it as an extension and open-source project if anyone is interested in using it or contributing to it.

Some other informations :
 - Texts and errors are written in french, music genres in english
 - It only works on music records
 - RYM uses a protection against automated scripts that block requests after multiple requests. You then have to manually prove on RYM that you're not a robot (with a Captcha)
